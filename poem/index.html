    <h1> The Romeo and Juliet Prologue: A Sonnet </h1>
   
    <h4> by William Shakespearce</h4>

    <p>

        <p>Two households, both alike in dignity,
            <br>
        In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
            <br>
        From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
            <br>
        Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
            <br>
    </p>

        <p>From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
            <br>
        A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
            <br>
        Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
            <br>
        Do with their death bury their parents' strife.
            <br>
    </p>


        <p>The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
            <br>
        And the continuance of their parents' rage,
            <br>
        Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,
            <br>
        Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
            <br>
    
    </p>


        <p>The which if you with patient ears attend,
            <br>
        What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
            <br>
    
    </p>
